## Output Requirements
You MUST produce a handoff document as your final output. Structure your response as valid JSON matching the handoff schema provided via --json-schema.
After implementing, run the acceptance criteria checks yourself before producing the handoff.

Key fields in the handoff:
- task_completed: summary of what you did and whether it's fully complete
- deviations: any changes from the plan with reasons
- bugs_encountered: problems found and their resolutions
- architectural_notes: key decisions for future iterations
- files_touched: every file you created, modified, or deleted
- plan_amendments: suggestions for plan changes (max 3)
- constraints_discovered: limitations found during implementation
