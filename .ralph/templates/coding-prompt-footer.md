## When You're Done

After completing your implementation and verifying the acceptance criteria,
write a handoff for whoever picks up this project next.

Your output must be valid JSON matching the provided schema.

The `summary` field should be a single sentence describing what you accomplished.

The `freeform` field is the most important part of your output — write it as
if briefing a colleague who's picking up tomorrow. Cover:

- What you did and why you made the choices you made
- Anything that surprised you or didn't go as expected
- Anything that's fragile, incomplete, or needs attention
- What you'd recommend the next iteration focus on
- Key technical details the next person needs to know

The structured fields (task_completed, files_touched, etc.) help the
orchestrator track progress. The freeform narrative is how the next
iteration will actually understand what happened.
