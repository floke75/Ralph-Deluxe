  "freeform": "Beginning the CLI integration module. The architecture wraps 'claude -p' with configurable timeout, output capture to temp file, and structured output parsing. Key design: response parsing needs a double jq pass because claude returns .result as a JSON string (not an object). Writing run_coding_iteration, run_memory_iteration, parse_handoff_output, and save_handoff functions. Dry-run mode will use the mock response fixture from tests/fixtures/mock-claude-response.json. This iteration is in progress."
